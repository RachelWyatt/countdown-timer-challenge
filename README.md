# README

This is a Ruby on Rails Application using Rails 6.0 and Ruby 3.0.0. 

## Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create an application that counts down from 14 days and matches a provided design.

Minimally, a user should be able to:
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a countdown time that ticks down every second.

## Running the Application
To run this code locally:
- Clone down the repo
- Either open the repo in a code editor or navigate to the code folder in a terminal
- Run `bundle install` to install the necessary Ruby gems
- Run `rails s` to start the Rails server
- In a browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000, where you should see the application
